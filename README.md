# Student Registration System

A simple, clean, and fully responsive web application for managing student records. This project allows users to add, view, edit, and delete student information seamlessly. The data is saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring that records persist even after a page refresh.

## Features

-   **Add New Students:** A dedicated form to enter and save the details of new students.
-   **View All Students:** A clear and organized table that displays all registered student records.
-   **Edit Existing Records:** Easily update the information for any student by clicking the "Edit" button.
-   **Delete Records:** Remove student records with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.
-   **Persistent Data:** All student data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so your information is saved between sessions.
-   **Input Validation:** The form includes real-time validation to ensure that data is entered in the correct format (e.g., names contain only letters, emails are valid).
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for a great user experience on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the application.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript (ES6):** For all the application's logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, data validation, and interaction with local storage.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Download the files:** Make sure you have the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files in the same folder.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
3.  **Start Using:** The application is now running locally, and you can start adding, editing, and managing student records.
